# MSME 
Internship cum skill development in Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises(MSME) ,Guindy.

# Week-1
1.Fundamentals: I've been diving deep into the core concepts of Python, including variables, data types, and string manipulation.

2.String Mastery: Explored various string methods like capitalize(), title(), find(), and isalpha(), which are essential for text processing.

3.GUI Development: Delved into GUI development using Tkinter, creating a login page, calculator, and a shopping discount calculator.

4.Hands-on Learning: Engaged in hands-on exercises, applying the learned concepts to practical projects.

5.Data Structures: Explored fundamental data structures like lists and tuples, learning their key methods and operations.

# Week-2
1.Data Structures:
*Sets: Explored unordered collections of unique elements, ideal for duplicate removal and its Key methods 
*Dictionaries: Learned about key-value pairs for efficient lookups. Focused on methods like get(), keys(), values(), and items().

2.Practical Application(Menu System): To solidify my understanding of these data structures, I developed a menu selection system. This hands-on exercise reinforced how to choose the right data structure for a given task and how to combine them effectively.

3.Object-Oriented Programming: My learning continued with an introduction to the fundamentals of object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python.  I covered the basics of classes and constructors, building a solid foundation for more complex projects.

4.Banking System Project with Flask (Day 10): The week culminated in a substantial project: creating a banking system.  This involved building both the backend logic and a frontend interface using the Flask framework.  This project brought together my knowledge of data structures, OOP, and web development principles.

# WEEK-3  

1.Functions & Classes:
 Building reusable code blocks with functions and creating blueprints for objects with classes. Practical application through a bank management system project.

2.Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):
*Inheritance: Exploring different inheritance types:
 >Single: One derived class inherits from one base class.
 >Multiple: One derived class inherits from multiple base classes.
 >Multilevel: A derived class inherits from a base class, which in turn inherits from another base class.
 >Hierarchical: Multiple derived classes inherit from the same base class.
 >Hybrid: A combination of different inheritance types.
*super() method: Calling methods from parent classes for code reuse and cleaner OOP. Practical examples with shapes, area calculations, and employee salary classes.
*Dunder (Magic) Methods: Special methods like _init_ and _str_ for operator overloading and class behavior customization.
*Polymorphism: Objects responding uniquely to the same method, improving code flexibility.
*Exception Handling: Using try, except, and finally blocks for robust error management.

3.Web Development:
*HTML: Learning fundamental HTML tags for structuring web pages.
*Flask Framework: Introduction to Flask and its key methods for building dynamic and interactive web applications.

I'm excited to continue this learning journey and delve into more advanced Python concepts.

#WEEK-4

1.Entrepreneurship: Explored future vision, employee vs. employer mindsets, financial management (including savings and investments), and business support schemes.
2.Web Development (HTML & Flask):Deepened understanding of backend integration. Improved web development workflow knowledge.
3.Gained hands-on experience:
 -Student details management system.
 -Hotel menu creation (HTML).
 -Hotel menu integration with Flask.
