# MSME 
Internship cum skill development in Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises(MSME) ,Guindy.

# Week-1
1.Fundamentals: I've been diving deep into the core concepts of Python, including variables, data types, and string manipulation.

2.String Mastery: Explored various string methods like capitalize(), title(), find(), and isalpha(), which are essential for text processing.

3.GUI Development: Delved into GUI development using Tkinter, creating a login page, calculator, and a shopping discount calculator.

4.Hands-on Learning: Engaged in hands-on exercises, applying the learned concepts to practical projects.

5.Data Structures: Explored fundamental data structures like lists and tuples, learning their key methods and operations.

# Week-2
1.Data Structures:
*Sets: Explored unordered collections of unique elements, ideal for duplicate removal and its Key methods 
*Dictionaries: Learned about key-value pairs for efficient lookups. Focused on methods like get(), keys(), values(), and items().

2.Practical Application(Menu System): To solidify my understanding of these data structures, I developed a menu selection system. This hands-on exercise reinforced how to choose the right data structure for a given task and how to combine them effectively.

3.Object-Oriented Programming: My learning continued with an introduction to the fundamentals of object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python.  I covered the basics of classes and constructors, building a solid foundation for more complex projects.

4.Banking System Project with Flask (Day 10): The week culminated in a substantial project: creating a banking system.  This involved building both the backend logic and a frontend interface using the Flask framework.  This project brought together my knowledge of data structures, OOP, and web development principles.

I'm excited to continue this learning journey and delve into more advanced Python concepts.
